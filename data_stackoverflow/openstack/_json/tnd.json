        "text": "b'how to pin openstack container versions when using kolla-ansible?'. b' when installing openstack via kolla-ansible you specify openstack version in globals.yml, ie: openstack_release: victoria. this is as specific as you can get, there are no point-in-time tags, just a moving target like victoria. in my experience containers are updated randomly, not all-at-once, and frequently. every time rebuild im having to wait for docker to pull down things which have changed since my last deploy. this is problematic for multiple reasons, most acutely: this is a fast-moving community-driven project. im having to work through new issues every few times rebuild as a result of changes. if deploy onto one set of hosts, then deploy onto more hosts hours later, im waiting again on updates, and my stack is running containers of different versions. these pulls take time and make my deployments vulnerable to timeouts and network problems. to emphasize what a problem the second issue is, usually can reset a failed deployment and try again, but not always. there have been times where had residual issues, and due to my noobness it was quicker to dump fresh disks and start over. im using external ceph colocated with the compute nodes. resetting pool state to an earlier point in time isnt in my toolbox yet, so also wipe my osds and redo the ceph installation. can pin version on ceph containers, but start to sweat once the kolla-ansible installation starts. for a total install, theres a not-small chance that another container will change in this time. the obvious answer for anybody who does or software professionally is to pin my kolla:* container versions to a specific point-in-time tag, and not victoria. could pin each container to a digest, but thats not supported in the playbooks as written. id need to edit ansible playboooks and add a variable for every container that want to pin. and then maintain that logic as new containers are added. im pulling containers right now. this approach feels like trailer park girls go round the outside. far simpler approach which im planning is to pull all the victoria-tagged containers, and then iterate through pushing them back into my own docker repo and then update globals.yml to use this stable tag. im new to managing my own docker repos, so dont know if can retag images in a pull-through cache, or if need to set up a private repo for that, so may also have to switch kolla-ansible between docker.io and a private feralcoder repo, depending on whether want to do a latest-pull or a pinned-pull. that would be a little hey nineteen, cleaner and nicer, still not quite right... feel like this pull-retag-push-reconfigure-redeploy approach is hack jankery. does anybody have a better suggestion? like, to not check upstream for container changes if theres already a tag-match in the local mirror? or maybe a way to pull-thru-and-retag, at the registry level? thanks, in advance, and also thanks to the kolla-ansible contributors for all their work, short of not providing version stability."
